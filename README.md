# Vibe common Hugo module

This is a [Hugo module][1] shared by [blog][2] (and portal in the future). It contains base template and other
shared components such as navigation bar, footer, etc.

## Local development

For development, it is usually convenient to replace module dependencies with your local clone so that you can test
your changes with zero turn around time.  See [go mod replace][3].
